#How to Update this...

I am assuming tht you are on Ubuntu 

And you have 

* Created the git project on the Web


#Clone it into Ubuntu
   git clone https://github.com/omanwhite/DataSciences-JohnHopkins

#Modify something

  cd DataSciences-JohnHopkins
  echo "Mod" >> README.md

#We can see the status of our project with

   git status

#Lets **locally** commit

   git commit -a -m "Stupid and needless edit"

#Lets send this Edit back to the server....


    git push
        user:omanwhite
        pass:OhN0Th1sn0tsecre1

And thats it....
